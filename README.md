DRIVE DB (Car Management System) (C Programming)

Project Overview

The Car Management System is a robust application built using C programming that provides efficient management and operations on a linked list of cars. It allows users to perform several actions such as adding, removing, and viewing cars, as well as sorting them based on various attributes. This project highlights my ability to work with linked lists, memory management, and file handling in C, providing a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms.

Key Features:
	•	Add Car: Dynamically add a new car to the system with attributes such as car ID, model, type, price, and year of manufacture.
	•	Remove Car: Remove a car from the system either by position or by removing all cars.
	•	View Cars: Print the details of all cars or view a single car by its position in the list.
	•	Sort Cars: Sort the cars in the list based on their car ID.
	•	Memory Management: Handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using linked lists to store car data.
	•	User Interaction: Interactive CLI prompts that provide a seamless experience for users to perform the required operations.

Technologies Used
	•	Language: C
	•	Data Structure: Singly Linked List
	•	Libraries: Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h)

Core Functionalities:
	1.	Add Car:
	•	Users can add new cars to the system with details like car ID, model, type, price, and year.
	2.	Remove Car:
	•	Single Removal: A car can be removed by specifying its position in the list.
	•	All Removal: Remove all cars from the list with a confirmation prompt.
	3.	Display Cars:
	•	All Cars: List all cars in the system, displaying each car’s ID, model, type, price, and year.
	•	Single Car: Display details of a specific car based on its position in the list.
	4.	Sort Cars:
	•	Cars can be sorted by their car ID in ascending order.
	5.	Memory Management:
	•	Proper memory allocation and deallocation techniques are employed to ensure that the program handles resources efficiently.

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in the following areas:
	•	Linked Lists: Mastering the creation, manipulation, and traversal of singly linked lists.
	•	Memory Management: Implementing dynamic memory allocation and deallocation to efficiently handle large amounts of data.
	•	File Handling: (Potential for future expansion) Ability to work with file operations for saving and loading car data.
	•	User Interaction: Creating an intuitive CLI interface for better user experience.
	•	Sorting Algorithms: Implementing sorting algorithms to organize data effectively.

Challenges Faced
	•	Handling dynamic memory allocation effectively while ensuring there are no memory leaks.
	•	Implementing a user-friendly CLI interface to ensure smooth interaction for various operations.
	•	Ensuring robustness when dealing with edge cases, such as empty lists or invalid user inputs.

Future Enhancements
	•	File Handling: Save the car data to a file so that the list persists even after the program ends.
	•	More Sorting Options: Add sorting by other attributes like price or year of manufacture.
	•	Search Functionality: Implement a search function to find cars based on specific criteria (e.g., car model or type).
	•	GUI: Develop a graphical user interface for an even more intuitive experience.

To Run the Program
    • Navigate to Project Directory then do make to compile
    • To run do ./bin/carBase

This project is developed by Mohammed Afnaan Uddin. Feel free to fork or contribute to this project. You can reach out to me via LinkedIn for any queries or feedback.

Why this Project Stands Out:
	•	Real-World Application: The project demonstrates how linked lists can be used for real-world applications like car inventory management.
	•	Efficient Data Handling: The project efficiently handles dynamic data using memory management techniques.
	•	Impressive Functionality: The combination of add, remove, view, and sort operations demonstrates a well-rounded understanding of data structures.
